# Othello
Play the popular boardgame Othello, with options to log the game and play against the computer.

I made this as a summer code project along with my [chord finder](https://github.com/devansh2447/Chord-Finder) program.

This program provides basic gameplay for Othello within Java.

User versus user gameplay:

Features:
- Play Othello (user versus user or computer versus user) on any system with Java installed.
- Save game logs to your disk.
- Works within the terminal (interface is text-based)

How to run:
- Any system (IDE): Import the .jar file or the code, and run the main method from the class Main with the argument {}.
- Any system (terminal): Ensure that Java is installed, then open a terminal window in the folder where the .jar file is saved and run 
   following command:  java -jar Othello.jar
- From .bat file (Windows only): Ensure that the .jar and .bat file are in the same directory, then run the .bat file.

Note: The option to play against the computer does NOT use AI. However, it was good enough to beat me (but I am not so good at the game).
